# Connection string for FastAPI (using same creds or app_user if you prefer, usually admin for initial setup/dev is easier, but let's stick to the generated app_user from migrations if we want strictness. However, migrations create app_user, so let's provide the URL for that).
# Note: app_user password is defined in 001_init_roles.sql as 'AppUser123!'
